    	<h1>COVID-19 Status Reports</h1>
    	<p>
    		This page uses data from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins CSSE</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data">the New York Times</a> (for US state level data), and the Robert Koch Institute via <a href="https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/dd4580c810204019a7b8eb3e0b329dd6_0">this</a> api (for German Bundesl√§nder data) to create charts on the status of COVID-19 cases and deaths around the world. It is updated once a day around 10:00am CET. The code used to make this site is hosted <a href="https://github.com/dhopp1/COVID-19-status-reports">here</a>. The moving average smoothing dropdown applies only to the new cases/deaths graphs and cases/deaths acceleration graphs, as these can change greatly from day to day, making trends hard to spot. Country groupings such as North America come from Wikipedia, but to see specifically which countries are included in each group check the <i>country_groups.csv</i> file <a href="https://github.com/dhopp1/COVID-19-status-reports/tree/master/plots/data">here</a>.
    		<br><br>
    		<strong>*Note:</strong> if you choose two countries with a large discrepency in case load, e.g. US and Cuba, the smaller country's curves will probably be invisible due to the scale. Set the second country to one with a more similar caseload to the smaller country, or set the second country to "None" to see the curve more clearly.
